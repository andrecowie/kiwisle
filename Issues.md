# Issue Log
One issue that is clear and we have all discussed was our lack of commitment during our first iteration, planning inclusive. Identifing this issue and aligning with the team will ensure it will not arise again. 

A lack of time due to other commitments is hindering progress on the project. In particular, other course work requires completion.
