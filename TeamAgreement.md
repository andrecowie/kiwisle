## Meetings: 

Meeting will be held in labs and also after lectures. Times and location will be decided through our private Facebook group chat. Further meeting will be will be scheduled. M Each member must attend and be on time for the meeting. If a member is unable to attend they have 24 hours before the meeting to inform the project leader and the team that they are unable to make the meeting. The group will use GitHub as version control  and will use that to work offsite. In addition, when further meeting time is required, the team will communicate and hold another meeting to meet requirements. 

## Commitment:  

Each member of this group will be committed to towards this project until the end duration of this project. If a member is not committed towards the portfolio. The members of the portfolio will contact the teaching assistant and lecture.  

## Respect: 

Each member of the group must respect each other and give them the opportunity to speak and give their opinion and idea in this portfolio.  

## Problems: 

As a group if a problem arises within this group project, we as a group will be willing and able to solve this problem. If the problem is not resolved, then we will need the support our teaching assistant and lecture.  

## Experience: 

As a group we understand that the group project will be challenging but we will be learning to enjoy the experience and learn from the mistakes that we would make.  

## Team Collaboration: 

We plan on using a private GitHub repository to collaborate on our code, OneNote for our documentation and messenger for keeping in touch when offsite. 

#### How will your team work together on this project? 

We will create a private GitHub repository for us to control our versions of files as we progress through the project. We will create branches for each story/new feature we are working on. We will try to have everyone working on seperate branches to reduce merge conflicts and increase productivity. We will highlight a plan for our git strategy in our planning.

#### How will you share the work?

We will collaborate by making sure that everyone is either trying to implement a feature or to test a feature that is being built by a team mate. This will ensure that everyone will take part in the building of Kiwi Island Version 2.

#### How will you keep track of how much work is completed and how much still to do?

The stories that still need to be finished will be in the iteration backlog. Only the stories in the iteration backlog will be worked on during that iteration. E.G, only the stories in the iteration 1 backlog, will be worked on during iteration 1. 
Stories that have been completed in an iteration will be marked as 'completed' on OneNote as that everyone knows that that story has been completed.
The product backlog will need to be constantly refined or 'groomed' so the team can understand and break down large stories. This will help the team what is coming up, and what is changing.
