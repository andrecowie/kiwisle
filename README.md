# KIWISLE
### Things for ITERATION 1
* Setup size of the map.
* Size of the map scales.
* Give an overview of how to play the game on first run.
* Create file on first run afteruser gets chance to create user account.

Goals!

Due in this Sunday.

I think we should be using just Git and Github plus Markdown to document our developments.
Fragmenting the teams documentation and work between OneNote, Planner and then using Git + Github for our code seems inefficient for our digital purposes.
The lack of teaching on how to work with Git has not been addressed properly in this degree properly I(Andre) feel. 
When we where told theoritically of our "programmering toolbox" in our first papers. The tool of working together, Git has been missed or not instructive enough. I feel competent in it due to much use, but i commonly come across student uncertain discussion around the topic and how to utilise it's features. Due to the "Cyclone Cook Closure" and cancellations this hasn't been addressed. I think it could help with our teams efficiencies and transperancy.

### Thoughts on ITERATION 1

I am disappointed in our team's communication. We received a bad mark and we will need to work on our roles and expectations for this paper. I think we found the speed of this iterative approach for the portfolio very fast, especially given the time allocated with relation to all of our teams external commitments. While being our first project together I feel we can use these circumstances to improve our focus for the upcoming iterations to yield better results. I have been doing some work on the entry screen and contemplating the way to refactor or change the build flow of the game object. It is unscalable for KiwiIsland to be built by a single text file intertwined so tightly with the map and game. Passing the name through as I am doing with this commit is not the best change but it gives me the confidence to begin thinking about changing more of the initialiseIslandFromFile as well as providing a good branch point. I will continue to work on a new branch with a change in the games setup process. Looking especially into the setUpTerrain, setUpPlayer and potentially the setUpOccupants methods within the Game class.

We need to improve our teams communication, and have to make changes for more effective team meeting. Since we recieved a bad mark for our planning, we now know that our current team meeting strategy isnt working at the moment. Time management for everyone is required as everyone in this paper is focusing more on the Research and development paper.

The communication within the team has been poor. It seems that more team meetings should be held to enable each team member to see where the project is overall. We also need to structure our meetings better, we can identify what each team member is working, what obstacles are in the way and how to overcome them. I think problems from the iteration planning phase have propagated through to iteration 1 such as having developer stories as user stories. This may have lead to confusion and a lack of cohesion within the team. Unfortunately, I think this project had a low priority on everyone's 'to do' list and got overlooked.
