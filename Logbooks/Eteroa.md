# Eteroa's Logbook


Week 1 
Discussing the planning phase and then contiuning on the Kiwi island game. I got to  
finally play the game and understand the way kiwi island worked.

Week 2
We begin to team build so i was set aside to create the project agreement. I don't have 
a strong prgramming skill as my other team mates but I am willing to upskill along the 
way. 

Week 3
Still on the concept development my team mates and I began with userstories that will be 
involved in the new and imporved version of kiwi island. We then begain to prepare for 
our Iteration preparation.

Week 4
The iteration preparation was done with Alex doing the class and Andre, Ben and I worked 
at our user stories.

Week 5
Iteration 1 was diffuclt for me as I didnt contribute as much as much as I could. I believe that
I fouced to much on my other subjects. 

Week 6
Iteration 2 I was able to talk to Andre and Ben to see what I can do. Becasue they worked 
hard on the developing stage. 

Week7 
Andre asked me to have a look at one of the resporsity for the kiwi island. I'm having a look
at it and just adjusting it a bit.

Week 8 
Currently uodated my log book with all that has been happening throughout the project.
