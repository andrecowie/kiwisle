|14/05| 3 | Working hard to finish off some of the other teams tasks had a good play with the Gridpanel class to attempt rendering icons to the JLabels hit a bit of a roadbump so commented out my code with the ugly icons (Thanks Ben ;). Tried also to work with a player icon which also worked. Did work on the difficulties and the spawning of items. Sorry for not being able to commit as I worked was away in dunedin and couldn't reliably access a network.|
