# Risk Identification

Title | Description | Resolution | Updates
--- | --- | --- |---
Team not communicating | This is a risk as coming in from Iteration 1 we could be unmotivated to work on this project. | We have had a meeting on the 2nd and 4th of May. We need to communicate more over distance we will try to improve in this area coming end of iteration 2 (14th May) | We have recognized this risk in our meeting on the 2nd will update.
Integration of seperate versions | If Alex, Andre and Ben are working on seperate methods in the same file on different branches and modifying seperate parts of the file. There is a potential risk of merge conflicts which could slow down our development as they would take to time resolve, wasting resource. | Communicate merging of branches and when commits are starting to resemble functional features. | We have recognized this risk in our meeting on the 4th will update.
Scheduling and Commitment | We all have other commitments (Uni courses, Work, Family, etc...) this could make difficult for us to schedule time to work on this project | We will try to communicate transperantly about any external responsibilities that could impact the amount of work we could do on KiwiIsle. One large one for three of our team members, is the amount of work required for our seperate R & D projects. | Identifyed at the meeting on the 4th of May.
Skill levels | This is a risk as it shows the different skills among the team and how if we don't use the different types of skills to certain areas for the project it can bring an uncertainty for members on what they can do in the project. | We are slowly recoginizing this in our groups through the certain areas that each member takes towards this project.|We have come together to understand the different types of levels of skills and have managed to upskill.
Qualilty of the software | This would be based on how we mangage the software. From this we can check how we can solve the software bugs. This would be a risk becasue if we dont prevent these bugs we would end up with low qualility software.| We will check our software and test it for the qulaility.

Team not communicating | This is a risk as coming in from Iteration 1 we could be unmotivated to work on this project. | We have had a meeting on the 2nd and 4th of May. We need to communicate more over distance we will try to improve in this area coming end of iteration 2 (14th May) | UPDATE (16th May) The team has decided to have meetings twice a week; one on Thursday after 5:00pm and one on Sunday in the evening, usually about 8:00pm via Facebook group call.
Integration of seperate versions | If Alex, Andre and Ben are working on seperate methods in the same file on different branches and modifying seperate parts of the file. There is a potential risk of merge conflicts which could slow down our development as they would take to time resolve, wasting resource. | Communicate merging of branches and when commits are starting to resemble functional features. | UPDATE: During our digital meetings on Sunday we went through what we have committed and on what branches can be merged to the master branch.
Scheduling and Commitment | We all have other commitments (Uni courses, Work, Family, etc...) this could make difficult for us to schedule time to work on this project | We will try to communicate transperantly about any external responsibilities that could impact the amount of work we could do on KiwiIsle. One large one for three of our team members, is the amount of work required for our seperate R & D projects. | UPDATE: At the start of the meeting each member of the team will say if there are any barriers or other commitments which may slow down their work. This will help each member know where the overall project sits.
Skill levels | This is a risk as it shows the different skills among the team and how if we don't use the different types of skills to certain areas for the project it can bring an uncertainty for members on what they can do in the project. | We are slowly recoginizing this in our groups through the certain areas that each member takes towards this project.|We have come together to understand the different types of levels of skills and have managed to upskill.
