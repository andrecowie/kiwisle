Team not communicating | This is a risk as coming in from Iteration 1 we could be unmotivated to work on this project as well as being bogged down in other commitments | We have had a meeting on the 2nd and 4th of May. We need to communicate more over distance we will try to improve in this area coming end of iteration 2 (14th May) | We have recognized this risk in our meeting on the 2nd will update.
Integration of seperate versions | If Alex, Andre and Ben are working on seperate methods in the same file on different branches and modifying seperate parts of the file. There is a potential risk of merge conflicts which could slow down our development as they would take to time resolve, wasting resource. | Communicate merging of branches and when commits are starting to resemble functional features. | We have recognized this risk in our meeting on the 4th will update.
