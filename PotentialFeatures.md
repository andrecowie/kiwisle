- Making the map dynamically on creation
  * Random placement of traps, items, Kiwis, Predators, player and potentially terrain
- Predators can move – hunt for kiwis, attack players
- Difficulty system – easy, norm, hard
  * Map setup( size of the map, number of occupants) in reference to the difficulty.
  * Number of predators and traps will differ on the difficulty of the map (increases number of the predator and traps as difficulty gets harder)
  * Size of the map will differ on the difficulty of the map (increases its size as difficulty gets harder) 
  * Speed of the occupants  
  * How many grid the occupant can move at each turn 
  * The interaction between each move and events.  
- Improvement on GUI 
  * From boxes to actual texture/adding images to occupants as well as the player 
  * Animation - sprites 
- Items 
  * Binoculars – extra vision/removes the fog of war 

This is due to the proposed extension of the map
